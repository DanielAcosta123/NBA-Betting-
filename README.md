# NBA-Betting-

This is a program the uses the NBA's API to retrieve the score for ongoing NBA games. The users can also access the teams with the highest points per game and the lowest points allowed. With this information, users can check competitive games as well as use offensive statistics and defensive statistics to make educated bets. 

The NBA program uses another module that utilizes a currency converter. The currency converter allows users to make bets in their home currency, which will then be translated to the currency of their choice. They can then place their bets using the currency that they have selected. Once the game is completed, users will be able to check their total balance.
